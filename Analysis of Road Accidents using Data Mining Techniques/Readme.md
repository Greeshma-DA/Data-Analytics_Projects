The several attributes involved in the accidents were investigated and applied association rule mining, clustering, and Naïve Bayes 
classification to find relationships among the attributes and the patterns.

Data Preparation: 

Data preparation was performed before each model construction. All records with missing value in the chosen attributes were removed. 
All numerical values were converted to nominal values. Fatal rate were calculated and binned to two categories: high and low. Several 
variables are calculated from other independent variables.

Modelling: 

We first calculated several statistics from the dataset to show the basic characteristics of the fatal accidents. We then applied association 
rule mining, clustering, and Naïve Bayes classification to find relationships among the attributes and the patterns.

Result Analysis: 

The results of our analysis include association rules among the variables, clustering of regions in Trivandrum on the number of fatal 
accidents, and classification of the regions as being high or low risk of fatal accident. We used python to perform these analysis.
