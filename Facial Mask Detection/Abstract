Objective: 
To construct a CNN model to detect if a person is wearing a face mask or not, with a webcam or mobile camera. 
As an extension, we are also planning to identify the masked person using his features.


About the Project: 
In this project, we have decided to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow with Keras 
library and OpenCV to detect if we are wearing a face mask or not.


The Dataset:
For building this model, we will be using three types of masked face datasets, including Masked Face Detection Dataset (MFDD), 
Real-world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD) and Simulated Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD).
